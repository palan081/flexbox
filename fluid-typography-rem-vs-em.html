<h1>Fluid Typography with em and rem Units</h1>
<p> Using relative units such as em and rem for typography provides flexibility and scalability across
    various screen sizes and device settings. While em units are relative to the font size of the parent element,
    rem units are relative to the root (html) element. </p>
<p> By using relative units like em and rem, you establish typographic system that adapts smoothly to change in font sizes preferences and viewport </p>
